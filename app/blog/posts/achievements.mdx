Layoffs can happen unexpectedly, and often the decisions are beyond our control. But there are a few things you can do to help ensure your contributions are visible within your organisation.

Here’s what I've learned about protecting your position by staying visible, taking ownership, and also building expertise.

#### 1. Be Loud About Your Accomplishments

A lot of layoff decisions are made at the VP level or higher, and the worst-case scenario is that your name comes across their desk, and they struggle to recall who you are or what you’ve done. The truth is, the only way higher-ups know about your work is if you make it known.

Be proactive in sharing your accomplishments. Volunteer to present your work in team meetings, offer to hold lunch-and-learn sessions, or showcase case studies of your work at company offsites. Make sure that those in leadership have a clear picture of your contributions and the value you bring to the team.

#### 2. Volunteer to Own "Hairy" Problems

The tasks no one else wants to handle can often become a safe space. By picking up difficult problems, you make yourself indispensable. If you’re the one handling these issues, it becomes harder for the organisation to let you go without losing critical work.

#### 3. Establish Yourself as a SME

Being known as the go-to person for specific, critical skills can make a real difference when decisions about layoffs are made. Keep an open door and be willing to share your expertise with colleagues. This positions you as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) in key areas and makes your skill set stand out. In times of change, having specialised knowledge and being a resource for others can make you an invaluable team member.

Protecting your role is about being intentional and visible in your contributions. Share your work, take on important challenges then try to establish yourself as an expert.
