In this article, we'll embark on a journey to create a simple and useful open source React component using AI assistance, build it on top of [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and draw inspiration from [ShadCN/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/). Our toolset will include [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) as our IDE, [GitHub](https://github.com/) for version control, pnpm for package management, and also [Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://www.claude.ai/). 

The final goal is to publish this component as a public npm package and develop a landing page using [v0](https:v0.dev), integrated with [ShadCN/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components. Please note that this article will focus on the conceptual aspects of this process, and will not delve into basic commands such as changing directories ```cd``` or other fundamental operations.




### Scope: building something you need
I would like to reccomend embracing the principle **Build the Things That You Wish Existed**. Select a simple component that solves a real issue. 

For inspiration, let's revisit Michael Andreuzza's informative post on [**How to Create a Scroll Progress Bar with Tailwind CSS and JavaScript**](https://lexingtonthemes.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-scroll-progress-bar-with-tailwind-css-and-javascript/). This serves as an excellent example to understand the component's functionality and code structure.

#### Pre-Cursor Setup
1. **Install Node**: Ensure Node.js is installed from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), which includes npm and pnpm. Feel free to use brew using the command 
 ```brew install node```
2. Initialize a Git Repository: ```git init```
3. Initialize NPM in Your Project: ```pnpm init```

#### **Opening and Configuring Your Project in Cursor**

- Open your project folder in Cursor then open the Composer using ```Cmd+I``` (MacOS) or ```Ctrl+I``` (Windows/Linux).
- Prompt for AI Assistance. Feel free to customize, adapt, and improve.

*Adapt and optimize the scroll progress bar code from [Michael Andreuzza's post](https://lexingtonthemes.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-scroll-progress-bar-with-tailwind-css-and-javascript/) for a React component. Utilize TypeScript, adhere to Next.js best practices with App Router, integrate with Tailwind CSS, and design the component based on ShadCN/UI principles. The goal is a customizable component (e.g., color, solid, gradients) to be saved as `/components/ui/scroll-progress-bar.tsx`.*

Cursor generated the following code for me, based on the Michael Andreuzza post. Please do not copy this code directly, as it is just a reference and an example for adaptation purposes.


```typescript
"use client";
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

interface ScrollProgressBarProps {
  className?: string;
}

const ScrollProgressBar: React.FC<ScrollProgressBarProps> = ({
  className = "fixed left-0 top-0 z-50 h-1",
}: ScrollProgressBarProps) => {
  const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleScroll = () => {
      const scrollableHeight =
        document.documentElement.scrollHeight - window.innerHeight;
      const scrolled = window.scrollY;
      const progress = (scrolled / scrollableHeight) * 100;
      setProgress(progress);
    };

    window.addEventListener("scroll", handleScroll);
    return () => window.removeEventListener("scroll", handleScroll);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div
      className={`${className} bg-gradient-to-tr from-indigo-800 via-indigo-700 to-indigo-900`}
      style={{ width: `${progress}%` }}
    />
  );
}

export default ScrollProgressBar;
```


### CLI Installation Setup
To streamline the component installation process, we'll create a CLI tool that automatically copies the component into the correct directory structure. 
Create a new file called `cli.ts` in your project and ask Cursor to generate that file for you. My file looks like this:

```typescript:cli.ts
#!/usr/bin/env node

import fs from "fs-extra";
import path from "path";
import { fileURLToPath } from "url";

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

async function init() {
  // Create components/ui directory if it doesn't exist
  const componentsDir = path.join(process.cwd(), "components", "ui");
  await fs.ensureDir(componentsDir);

  // Copy the component file
  const sourcePath = path.join(__dirname, "../src/scroll-progress-bar.tsx");
  const targetPath = path.join(componentsDir, "scroll-progress-bar.tsx");

  await fs.copy(sourcePath, targetPath);

  console.log("âœ… ScrollProgressBar component installed successfully!");
}

init().catch(console.error);
```

This CLI script simplifies the installation process by:
- Creating a `components/ui` directory if it doesn't exist
- Copying the scroll-progress-bar component to the correct location
- Providing feedback on successful installation

### Publishing Your Component as an npm Package

#### Creating an npm Account and Publishing

1. **Create an npm Account**: Visit [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) and follow the registration process.
2. **Login with pnpm**: ```pnpm login```
3. **Build and Test Your Package**: ```pnpm build```
4. **Publish Your Package**:```pnpm publish```



### Create Landing Page with v0 and ShadCN UI
The landing page is a separate project from your component. It aims to present your new component's concept, explain how to install and use it, and encourage open source contributions.
1. **Create a New Repository** for your landing page on GitHub.
2. **Set up v0**: Go to [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) and create a new project.
3. **Design Your Landing Page**: Use v0 to create a basic structure for your landing page. Include sections for: component overview, installation instructions, usage examples, customisation options and contribution guidelines.
4. **Integrate ShadCN/UI Components**: v0 supports ShadCN/UI components out of the box. Use these to create a consistent and attractive design.
5. **Add Your Component**: Create a section where you demonstrate your scroll progress bar component in action. This gives visitors a clear idea of what your component does.
6. **Create Documentation**: Write clear, concise documentation for your component. Include code snippets showing how to install and use the component in different scenarios.
7. **Encourage Contributions**: Add a section explaining how others can contribute to your project. Include links to your GitHub repository and any contribution guidelines you've set up.


The result can be viewed on the NPM package repository here at **[@leonardobetti/scroll-progress-bar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@leonardobetti/scroll-progress-bar)**. Also, you can see the basic landing page built with v0 and deployed on Vercel on this **[link here](https://react-scroll-progress-bar.vercel.app/)**.

That's it :) You've created, published, and showcased a customisable React component using AI, embodying open-source collaboration and design innovation. Remember to keep your landing page updated as your component evolves. Regular updates will help maintain interest in your project and encourage ongoing contributions from the community.

**Next Steps**:
- Share your project with others.
- Ask for feedback and help.
