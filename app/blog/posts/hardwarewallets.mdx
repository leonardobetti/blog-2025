If you’re not living under a rock, you’ve likely heard about Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in recent years. After some trial and error, it’s evident that many people entering the crypto space, whether as investors or traders, often try to apply traditional banking concepts to this new world. This approach leads to misunderstandings, especially regarding tools like hardware wallets.

Occasionally, a user may want to purchase a hardware wallet based on the common belief that their satoshis are somehow stored "inside" the device. Because the device is offline most of the time and marketed as secure, they assume their assets are entirely safe, as if stored in a bank vault. However, this belief misrepresents how Bitcoin works.

Bitcoin is a decentralised, peer-to-peer protocol within a distributed network. A Bitcoin transaction involves transferring bytes from one cryptographic key to another. A Bitcoin wallet, therefore, is simply a tool for interacting with these cryptographic keys: creating public/private key pairs, generating public addresses for receiving funds, checking balances, and more.

While hardware wallets provide an additional layer of security, they are not immune to risks like physical theft, tampering, or malware if misused. Moreover, they are not an "out-of-the-box" solution for private transactions, as many default to connecting to third-party public nodes.

The first step in securing your crypto assets is understanding who might attack you, the effort required to prevent such attacks, and the level of convenience you need. There is no universal solution that fits everyone. Your approach depends on how much you’re willing to learn, spend, and adapt your behaviour.

For example, an affordable solution for someone seeking a basic hardware wallet alternative could be using a USB stick loaded with a [Tails Linux](https://tails.boum.org) image.

[Tails](https://tails.boum.org) is a portable operating system designed to preserve privacy and anonymity. It can be run from a USB stick, leaving no trace on the computer you use. Tails routes all internet traffic through the Tor network, ensuring secure and private communication by default.

With Tails, you can use the [Electrum wallet](https://electrum.org)—an open-source Bitcoin wallet packed with features. Electrum enables you to securely manage your Bitcoin, including generating addresses, making transactions, and using advanced functionality. Tails’ Tor integration ensures your interactions with the Bitcoin network are private and harder to trace.

A USB stick is an affordable and accessible option for most users. You can further enhance security by encrypting the USB stick with a strong password. Electrum also uses the BIP-39 standard, meaning you’ll generate a set of seed words to recover your wallet if necessary. It’s crucial to write these words down using **pen** and **paper** and store them securely, as they are the key to accessing your assets. This setup requires some technical knowledge and effort but offers a balance of affordability, security, and privacy for users willing to invest time in learning the basics.
